# BikeShare
The Bike Sharing Demand competition on Kaggle challenges participants to forecast hourly bicycle rental demand for the Washington D.C. Capital Bikeshare system using historical usage patterns and associated weather and temporal data. In this regression-style prediction task, contestants leverage features like date/time, weather conditions, seasonality, and holiday indicators to estimate the total number of rented bikes for future hours, with submissions evaluated by Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE) against the actual counts. 

In this project, I explored advanced sequence modeling techniques and achieved a top-performing submission using a BART-based model, demonstrating strong ability to capture complex temporal and contextual patterns in the dataset and secure a leading placement on the competition leaderboard.
